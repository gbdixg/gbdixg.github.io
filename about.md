Hi, I'm Geoff Dixon. I live in the U.K. and work remotely on technology projects.

I've been self-employed for many years, working as an I.T. consultant for Fortune 100 companies, mainly in the financial sector.
Lifelong learning has been the only way to stay relevant and secure new projects. This blog helps to organise my thoughts and identify gaps in knowledge

I'm passionate about technology and spend way too much time building systems and coding solutions.
