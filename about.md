Hi, I'm Geoff Dixon and this is where I blog.<br>
I live in the U.K. and work remotely on technology projects.

I've been self-employed for many years, working as an I.T. consultant for Fortune 100 companies in the financial sector.
**<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning">Lifelong learning</a>** has been the only way to stay relevant and secure new projects.

I'm passionate about technology and spend way too much time building systems and coding solutions. 
This blog helps to organise my thoughts and identify gaps in knowledge

> When you do what you love, it's not work anymore.
