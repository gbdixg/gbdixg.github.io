Hi, I'm Geoff Dixon. I live in the U.K. and work remotely on technology projects.

I've been self-employed for many years, working as an I.T. consultant for Fortune 100 companies, mainly in the financial sector.
I'm passionate about technology and spend way too much of my spare time at a keyboard.

> When you do what you love, it's not work anymore.

I started programming in the 80's on a BBC Micro.  My first experience was a BBC Basic correspondence course at age 12, where all assignments were using pen and paper.
I "gave-up" computers in my later teens and only came back to I.T. when I needed a job.

My first I.T. job was on a telephone Helpdesk. I job-hopped a bit in the next few years, moving into PC Support followed by Server Operations. Those early roles were supporting Windows NT 3.5.1 with some Windows for Workgroups alongside.

After a few permanent roles, I got the opportunity to work as a consultant on a major office relocation and Windows platform transformation project. Over the next few years, I worked as a consultant for numerous financial companies on major Windows projects in the City of London.

I don't get a much time to blog due to the all-encompassing nature of project work and looking after two daughters (now both teenagers!).
