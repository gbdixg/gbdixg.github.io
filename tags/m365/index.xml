      <description>Sensitivity Labels and Purview Information Protection Policies Part Three</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Part three of a deep dive series on Purview Sensitivity Labels:</p>
<p>Part 1 - <a href="/2023/04/24/sensitivitylabelspt1/">Manual Labelling</a><br>
Part 2 - <a href="/2023/04/25/sensitivitylabelspt2/">Automatic Labelling</a><br>
Part 3 - Recommendations and Limitations</p>
<h2 id="labelling-recommendations">Labelling Recommendations</h2>
<p>Data Classification requires broad organizational support to be successful. The following design recommendations should help with implementation&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Keep the number of labels to a minimum</strong><br>
Labelling needs to be simple and the options clearly defined, otherwise adoption will suffer</p>
<p><strong>Create separate labels for Items and Containers</strong><br>
Item and Container Labels apply different controls. Separate labels means the name and description can be clearer. For example, <em>Confidential</em> may be suitable for documents, but it would be less clear for M365 Groups.</p>
<p><strong>Create separate labels for Files, Emails and Meetings</strong><br>
There are sub-scopes within Items for Files, Emails and Meetings (Calendar events). Again, the controls are different so labels can be more specific if targeted. For example, email labels can control view, reply, forwarding, whereas file labels can control Save, Print, Copy, Expiry, Offline Access.</p>
<p>It helps that client apps only show labels applicable to the current scope, so a label scoped to <strong>Items - Email</strong> will not be displayed in a document, spreadsheet or presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Create a baseline set of company-wide labels and a small number of targeted additions</strong><br>
A core set of labels should be applicable to everyone. Specific departments or teams may need extra labels for custom data, such as <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/PII" target="_blank">PII</a>, or <em>Blueprints</em>. Label policies can deploy the extra labels just to specific AAD groups.</p>
<p><strong>Create labels that will endure over a long period</strong><br>
Choose labels that will still be applicable in years to come and then consult users (and perhaps run a limited pilot) to get labels right before mass adoption.  Deleting labels is problematic. The label is added to the metadata of items and deleting the label does not remove it from the metadata. The recommended way to retire a label is to stop publishing it (label policy), but don&rsquo;t delete the label itself.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid sub labels</strong><br>
There are some quirks with sub labels and they don&rsquo;t add much value.</p>
<p><strong>Use same text for the Label Name and Display Name</strong><br>
The Label Name is used internally and the Display Name is visible to users. Making them different is just adding complexity. The label is actually assigned a GUID that must be used in advanced administrator operations anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t apply policy controls straight-away</strong><br>
Consider publishing Labels and using them without controls initially. You can then use the Data Classification <em>Content Explorer</em> and <em>Activity Explorer</em> to review how Labels are being used before applying that knowledge to policy creation.</p>
<p><strong>Use file encryption to protect intellectual property</strong><br>
Employee-only content can be encrypted with <em>Co-Author permissions</em> for <em>All users and groups in your organization</em>. Leavers who attempt to take protected data with them will be denied access when their account is disabled. Protected Data sent or copied to a third party will be inaccessible.</p>
<p><strong>Create an FAQ and include the link in the Label Policy</strong>
Users will need reassurance to feel confident in applying labels with content restrictions. There will also be edge cases that need more information. Label Policies include an option to deploy a URL help link.</p>
<h2 id="check-your-service-and-tenant-settings">Check your Service and Tenant settings</h2>
<p>Depending on the age of your Tenant, the following may already be enabled&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="enable-sensitivity-labels-for-office-files-in-sharepoint-and-onedrive">Enable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive</h3>

<p>Sensitivity Labels and their descriptions can be localised to match the Office language. Local language support can only be added using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/set-label?view=exchange-ps#example-1" target="_blank">Set-Language PowerShell command</a>.</p>
<p>Set-Label is available in the Security and Compliance PowerShell module (available after using Connect-IPPSSession from the ExchangeOnlineManagement PowerShell module).</p>
<p>You may see references to adding multi-language support using an XML export and import process in the Azure Information Protection blade of the Azure Portal. This method relates to AIP Classic that is now deprecated.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<h3 id="supported-office-versions">Supported Office versions</h3>
<p>Sensitivity Labels are not supported in the Office Desktop <em>Perpetual Editions</em> (standalone). In addition, a subscription version of Office must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semi-annual Enterprise 2002+</li>
<li>Monthly Enterprise and Current Channel 1910+</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-versions?view=o365-worldwide#sensitivity-label-capabilities-in-word-excel-and-powerpoint" target="_blank">some features that require later versions</a>, such as <em>Dynamic content marking</em>, <em>Let users assign permissions</em> and <em>audit label-related user activity</em>.</p>
<h3 id="user-encryption-over-ride">User encryption over-ride</h3>
<p>Users are able to over-ride the encryption settings applied by a manual label. After they apply the label to their content, they can make changes to the protection using File &gt; Info &gt; Protect Document &gt; Restrict Access.</p>
<p>The only way to avoid this is to provide at least one Label with <em>Let users assign their own permissions</em> and educate users to choose this Label rather than modifying a pre-configured one.</p>
<h3 id="lost-email-labels">Lost Email Labels</h3>
<p>Labelled emails can lose their Label when a reply comes from an external organization that doesn&rsquo;t use Outlook.  Any encryption is retained, but the original Label will be removed.</p>
<h3 id="encrypt-with-password-missing-in-pdf">&ldquo;Encrypt with Password&rdquo; missing in PDF</h3>
<p>If a PDF is encrypted with Information Protection, the Adobe option to <em>Encrypt with Password</em> is no longer available.</p>
<h3 id="limits-on-sharepoint-auto-labelling">Limits on SharePoint auto-labelling</h3>
<p>Service-side Auto-Labelling for SharePoint and OneDrive has some limitations when scanning data at rest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum of 25,000 files labelled per day</li>
<li>Maximum of 100 Auto-label policies per Tenant</li>
<li>Maximum of 100 Sites (SPO or OneDrive) when targeting individual Sites in a policy (alternative is to target <em>All Sites</em>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limits-on-sharepoint-indexing">Limits on SharePoint indexing</h3>
<p>SharePoint can&rsquo;t index encrypted files that have any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expiring access</li>
<li>Double-key encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>This affects search, preview and e-Discovery.</p>
<h3 id="update-delays">Update delays</h3>
<p>Updates to Labels can take a few hours to apply and be visible to users. Similarly, there is often a delay with publishing Label Policies.</p>
<p>SharePoint caches Labels and Label Policies, so changes can take even longer e.g. 24hrs.</p>

      <description>Sensitivity Labels and Purview Information Protection Policies Part Two</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Part two of a deep dive series on Purview Sensitivity Labels:</p>
<p>Part 1 - <a href="/2023/04/24/sensitivitylabelspt1/">Manual Labelling</a><br>
Part 2 - Automatic Labelling<br>
Part 3 - <a href="/2023/04/26/sensitivitylabelspt2/">Recommendations and Limitations</a></p>
<h2 id="automatic-labelling">Automatic Labelling</h2>
<p>Manual Labelling is often the introduction to Sensitivity Labels, but eventually you will want to look at automation. In particular, it will be needed to add coverage of data at rest. Manual labelling, even if mandatory, only applies when an existing file is re-saved.</p>
<p>The main blocker for many companies is that Automatic Labelling is not available with an E3 license. It requires either Microsoft 365 E5, or E3 plus <em>Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance</em> or <em>Microsoft 365 E5 Information Protection and Governance</em>.</p>
<p>There are two options for automatically applying Sensitivity Labels:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Client-side auto-labelling</strong> for files and emails</li>
<li><strong>Service-side auto-labelling</strong> for SharePoint Online, Exchange Online and OneDrive</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="client-side-auto-labelling">Client-side Auto-labelling</h3>
<p><em>Auto-labelling for files and emails</em> is a client option, configured per-label, that either automatically applies the label, or recommends it to the user based on pattern matching in the content.</p>
<p>Client-side auto-labelling only occurs when an item is being created or edited, it doesn&rsquo;t apply to data at rest or in-transit.
The auto-label policy is based on matching one or more <strong>Sensitive Info Types</strong> or <strong>Trainable Classifiers</strong>. For example, if the content matches a passport number.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/UsingMIPLabels/Label-AutoLabellingFiles.png" alt="Client Auto-Labelling"  />
</p>
<h3 id="service-side-auto-labelling">Service-side auto-labelling</h3>
<p><em>Service-side auto-labelling</em> is a separate option in the Information Protection blade of the Purview Compliance Center.  This option is not dependent on supported client apps or reliant on user adoption. Labels are applied by the back-end M365 services.</p>
<p>Create an <strong>Auto-labelling policy</strong> to apply one of the pre-defined labels to unlabelled data at rest in supported locations.<br>
The policy wizard has pre-defined <strong>Templates</strong> for matching content based on well-known regulatory and enterprise requirements. For example, the <em>UK Financial Template</em> includes the <em>Sensitive Info Types</em> that match credit card numbers, debit card numbers and SWIFT bank codes in the scanned content.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the <strong>Custom Template</strong> option creates a policy with bespoke pattern matching, as follows&hellip;</p>
<p>First select one or more of the supported storage locations to apply the automatic labelling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange Online</li>
<li>SharePoint Online</li>
<li>OneDrive for Business</li>
</ul>
<p>SharePoint and OneDrive both support auto-labelling of data at rest. Exchange Online only supports auto-labelling of data in-transit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/UsingMIPLabels/Label-Auto1.png" alt="Client Auto-Labelling"  />
</p>
<p>Next create rules containing include and exclude <strong>Conditions</strong> to identify items in-scope. A rule can contain multiple conditions and it can apply to all three storage locations, or be specific to a particular one.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions available for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business</strong>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Condition</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Content is shared</td>
<td>Inside or Outside the organisation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Content Contains</td>
<td>Sensitive Info Types and/or Trainable Classifiers</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Exchange Online has many additional Conditions:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>

<td>List of words in sender address or match to regex pattern</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Sensitive Info Types and/or Trainable Classifiers</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br/>
The additional conditions are only available for Exchange when creating a per-location rule.
<br/><br/>  
<p><strong>Simulation mode</strong> is a mandatory step in creating an auto-labelling policy. Content discovery takes place and the administrator can review matched items to ensure rules are correct. The policy can then be turned-on for real.</p>
<h2 id="sensitive-information-types">Sensitive Information Types</h2>
<p><em>Sensitive information Types</em> are search patterns for named data types. They are used to automatically classify content that matches the pattern, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>US / UK Passport number</li>
<li>SWIFT code</li>
<li>Japan Social Security Number</li>
<li>Credit Card Number</li>
<li>Azure AD client secret</li>
</ul>
<p>Sensitive Info Types can be used in Client-side and Service-side auto-labelling.</p>
<p>There is a long list of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitive-information-type-entity-definitions?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">built-in Sensitive Information Types (SIT) provided by Microsoft</a>. You can also create your own in the <a href="https://compliance.microsoft.com/dataclassificationclassifiers?viewid=sensitiveinfotypes" target="_blank">&lt;em&gt;Data Classification&lt;/em&gt; blade</a> of the Purview Compliance Center. Custom SITs are one of the following:</p>

<p>When you create a pattern-based Sensitive Info Type, you can specify a <strong>Primary element</strong> and <strong>Supporting elements</strong>. The elements consist of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular Expression</li>
<li>Keyword list</li>
<li>Keyword dictionary (longer list of keywords)</li>
<li>Existing Sensitive Info type</li>
</ul>
<p>The Secondary Element can be a list of the above, grouped by <em>Any, All or None</em>. The Primary Element and Supporting Elements can be anywhere in the document or near each other within a specified number of characters.</p>
<h3 id="fingerprint-based-sit">Fingerprint-based SIT</h3>
<p>A Fingerprint-based Sensitive Info Type is created by uploading an example document. It works best with Forms and Templates.</p>
<h2 id="trainable-classifiers">Trainable Classifiers</h2>
<p>This method of automatic-labelling is based on machine learning. A Classifier is trained to recognise a document through examples. The classifier must first be fed a selection of documents that are in-scope and out-of-scope of the required label.  The administrator must confirm or reject the automatic classification to train the learning model. It can then be applied to a bulk repository such as a document library.</p>
<p>Microsoft provides many <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/classifier-tc-definitions?view=o365-worldwide#trainable-classifiers-definitions" target="_blank">&amp;ldquo;ready-to-use&amp;rdquo; classifiers</a>, including ones to detect profanity, threats and discrimination and even resumes (CVs). Creating a custom Trainable Classifier requires at least 50 sample documents. It can take up-to 2 weeks to scan your environment using these classifiers.</p>
<p>Trainable Classifiers can be used in Client-side and Service-side auto-labelling. They can also be used to apply Retention Labels.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="exchange-mail-flow-rules">Exchange Mail Flow Rules</h2>
<p>Encryption can be applied using Labels in Exchange Mail Flow rules.  This option may be an attractive alternative if you don&rsquo;t have an E5 license that supports Automatic Label Policies. The Label and associated encryption is applied to messages in transit (not messages at rest in mailboxes).</p>
<p>Create a Rule as follows&hellip;<br>
In the <a href="https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Exchange Admin Portal</a>, select Mail Flow &gt; Rules &gt; Add a rule</p>
<p>In the drop-down list select the option to <em>Apply Office 365 Message Encryption and rights protection to messages</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/UsingMIPLabels/Label-MailFlow1.png" alt="Mail Flow Rule"  />
</p>
<p>Complete the <em>Rule Conditions</em> and select <strong>Rights protect message with [SELECTED LABEL]</strong></p>
<h2 id="sharepoint-default-sensitivity-label">SharePoint Default Sensitivity Label</h2>
<p>You can set a default Sensitivity Label for SharePoint content and it will apply to documents uploaded or re-saved in a Library. The setting can be applied at the Site Level (Settings &gt; Site Information) or the Library Level (Settings &gt; Library Settings). It requires Site Admin permissions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/UsingMIPLabels/Label-SPLibrary.png" alt="SPO Default"  />
</p>
<p>A manually-applied label will always <em>win</em> over a SPO Library default. The Library setting can override an auto-labelling policy or label policy default setting, if the Library setting is higher priority.</p>
<p>A SharePoint default Label only applies to new document uploads. Existing files in the Library only receive the Label when they are re-saved.</p>
<p>Labels with the following settings can&rsquo;t be used as a SharePoint default label:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Label with encryption set to <em>Let users assign permissions when they apply the label</em></li>
<li>A Label set to <em>In Word, PowerPoint and Excel, prompt users to specify permissions</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If a user manually removes encryption from a labelled document in a SharePoint Library, the encryption will be restored the next time it is accessed or downloaded.</p>
<p>The automatic Labelling process does not affect the Last Modified date of files.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> that an SPO Default Label is different to Label Policies that target SharePoint. Label Policies apply container settings such as external access.</p>
<h2 id="sharepoint-sensitivity-column">SharePoint Sensitivity column</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to update the <em>All Documents</em> view to show a column for Sensitivity</p>
<p>In a Library &gt; Add column &gt; Show or hide columns &gt; Select Sensitivity &gt; Apply
Then click the All Documents drop-down and select <em>Save view as</em>, leave the default &ldquo;All Documents&rdquo; and click Save</p>
<p>The Library will then always show the Sensitivity Label alongside the File Name and Modified Date.</p>
<h2 id="protecting-teams-meetings-and-chat">Protecting Teams Meetings and Chat</h2>
<p>A Label can be applied to Teams meetings and Chat if the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organization has a Teams Premium license (included in E5 but not E3)</li>
<li>The Label is scoped to both Files and Emails</li>
<li>The meeting owner is using M365 Apps for Enterprise or OWA on a Desktop computer (not supported on mobile apps)</li>
</ul>
<p>When encryption is turned-on, the following controls can be configured by the Label:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who can bypass the lobby</li>
<li>Who can present, record</li>
<li>Automatic recording</li>
<li>Prevent copy of meeting chat</li>
<li>Add a watermark during screen sharing and camera streams</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-azure-information-protection">What is Azure Information Protection?</h2>
<p><em>Azure Information Protection</em> (AIP) extends what is available in <em>Purview Information Protection</em> and also provides some of the services used by Purview Information Protection.
In its original form AIP used separate Sensitivity Labels managed in the Azure Portal. Since 2019, AIP has been updated with a <em>Unified Labelling Client</em> that uses Purview Sensitivity Labels.</p>
<p>The following are some reasons to extend the Data Classification Framework with AIP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bulk labelling and protection of <strong>on-prem file shares and SharePoint libraries</strong></li>
<li>Bulk decryption for data recovery</li>
<li>Apply labels directly from File Explorer or PowerShell</li>
<li>Supports additional file types for classification and protection</li>
<li>Supports Office 2003-2007 file formats</li>
<li>Logging to the Windows event log</li>
</ul>
<p>To use AIP you will need to deploy the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53018" target="_blank">unified labelling client</a> to Windows computers. You may see references in documentation to the AIP Classic Client. This is the older version of AIP that is now deprecated.</p>
<p>If the AIP client is installed, the built-in labelling interfaces in Office are disabled (e.g. the Ribbon Sensitivity button) and an Office add-in displays an information bar instead. It&rsquo;s a supported scenario to use AIP for some features while still using the built-in labelling for Office. To achieve this, just disable the AIP Office add-ins (MSIP.WordAddin, MSIP.ExcelAddin, MSIP.PowerPointAddin, MSIP.OutlookAddin) using a Group policy / CSP setting.</p>
<h3 id="aip-unified-labelling-scanner">AIP Unified Labelling Scanner?</h3>
<p>The Scanner works by running jobs that crawl the specified data stores to label and protect the documents. This can be a one-off exercise to ensure wide coverage (then relying on native labelling options), or it could be a repeat scheduled process.</p>
<p>The Scanner runs as a service on a Windows Server (2016 or later for long path support) and also requires a SQL server backend. It requires an application registration in Azure AD, that provides a token for the service to authenticate with AIP. The scan jobs are configured in the AIP blade of Azure rather than on the Server.</p>
<p>The process of scanning large data stores can be time consuming, so the Scanner supports inclusion and exclusion by file type (file extension) to pre-filter the file list.  It can also be clustered with multiple servers working in parallel. It uses the same built-in iFilters used by Windows Search to access document content and look for matches to automatic label patterns.</p>
<p>The Scanner can be run first in <em>Discovery Mode</em> to create a report of labels and protection that would be applied through automatic classification rules.</p>

<p>Part 1 - Manual Labelling<br>
Part 2 - <a href="/2023/04/25/sensitivitylabelspt2/">Automatic Labelling</a><br>
Part 3 - <a href="/2023/04/26/sensitivitylabelspt2/">Recommendations and Limitations</a></p>
<p>Purview Information Protection (formerly AIP and then MIP) uses <strong>Labels</strong> to categorise data based on sensitivity and privacy requirements. Settings and Policies linked to the labels apply security controls. This article is a deep dive on Information Protection, including design and configuration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sensitivity Labels</strong> are metadata added to <strong>items</strong> and <strong>containers</strong> to identify and enforce privacy constraints using  simple descriptions, such as <em>Company Confidential</em> or <em>Secret</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Labels and Label Policies are part of the M365 Data Classification Framework</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/UsingMIPLabels/MSOverview.png" alt="Label scope"  />
</p>
<h2 id="label-scope">Label Scope</h2>
<p>Applying Labels and Label Policies to <strong>Items</strong> is known as <strong>Information Protection</strong>.<br>
Items can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint etc)</li>
<li>Email messages</li>
<li>Calendar events and meetings</li>
<li>Teams meetings and chats (Teams Premium license required)</li>
</ul>
<p>M365 Apps (Office) files must be in the Open XML format e.g. docx, xlsx. Older formats such as .doc are not supported.</p>
<p>Applying Labels and Policies to <strong>Containers</strong> is known as <strong>Container Management</strong>.<br>
Containers (a.k.a <em>Groups &amp; Sites</em>) can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>SharePoint Online sites</li>
<li>Teams</li>
<li>M365 Groups</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/UsingMIPLabels/Label-Scope.png" alt="Label scope"  />
</p>
<p><strong>Purview Data Map</strong> is a third lesser-used label scope, that allows Labels to be applied to some Azure assets such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure SQL columns</li>
<li>Azure Cosmos DB</li>
<li>Azure MySQL</li>
<li>Azure Data Explorer</li>
</ul>
<p>Purview Data Labelling is not enabled by default. It can be turned-on in the Information Protection UI, or using the PowerShell compliance module.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="whats-in-a-name">What&rsquo;s in a name?</h2>
<p>Label names are freeform, configured by an administrator in the <a href="https://compliance.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Purview Compliance Center</a>. The label <em>display name</em> and <em>description</em> are visible to users and should be intuitive.</p>
<p>Items and Containers can only have one Sensitivity Label (although they can also have an M365 Retention Label - a separate topic).</p>
<h3 id="example-labels">Example Labels</h3>
<p>The following example is a baseline set of labels published to everyone in an organization:</p>
<table>

<h2 id="sub-labels">Sub labels</h2>
<p>Sub labels are used to group similar labels in a parent-child relationship. They are mainly for organisation, there&rsquo;s no inheritance of settings (although they do inherit the colour setting).<br>
In the example below, <em>Confidential</em> is the parent label and <em>Partners</em> and <em>Employees</em> are the two sub labels.</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIAL<br>
CONFIDENTIAL\PARTNERS<br>
CONFIDENTIAL\EMPLOYEES</p>
<p>To create a sub label, click the kebab menu (3-dots) next to an existing label and select <em>Create Sublabel</em>.</p>

<h2 id="label-priority">Label Priority</h2>
<p>Labels have a priority with (1) being least sensitive e.g. <em>Public</em>. The priority order is used to identify downgrading and to resolve conflicts.</p>
<p><em>Downgrading</em> occurs when users manually change a label to a less sensitive option. An Item Owner (person who applied the label) is free to change it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/UsingMIPLabels/Label-Priority.png" alt="Create sublabel"  />
</p>
<h2 id="label-policies">Label Policies</h2>
<p><strong>Label Policies</strong> have two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing labels so they are visible in supported apps</li>
<li>Controlling how labels are applied</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="publishing-labels">Publishing Labels</h3>
<p>Sensitivity Labels are published to <strong>users</strong>, either everyone in the organization, or a selected [mail-enabled] group. This is different to <em>Retention Labels</em> that are published to storage locations.</p>
<h3 id="controlling-how-labels-are-applied">Controlling how labels are applied</h3>
<p>The following options are available in a Label Policy, depending on the Label scope.</p>
<table>

<h3 id="default-vs-mandatory-labelling">Default vs Mandatory Labelling</h3>
<p><strong>User adoption</strong> is one of the key challenges of Sensitivity Labelling. The following options exist to help with this challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default Labels</li>
<li>Mandatory Labelling</li>
<li>Automatic Labelling</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be difficult to <strong>decide between default and mandatory labelling</strong>. If you configure default labels in the Label Polices, it will achieve the high-level goal of wide adoption, but it may fail to achieve a useful implementation. Users can just accept the default and make no effort to change it to something more appropriate.<br>
For this reason, <strong>mandatory labelling may be a better choice</strong>, forcing users to choose a label when they save a new item or modify an unlabelled one. If you enable mandatory labelling, make sure the Label Display Names and Descriptions are intuitive and explain details like encryption.</p>
<p>Mandatory Labelling = <em>Require users to apply a label to their emails and documents.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/UsingMIPLabels/Label-Mandatory.png" alt="Mandatory labelling"  />
</p>
<h2 id="encryption-permissions-and-usage-rights">Encryption, Permissions and Usage Rights</h2>
<p>Sensitivity Labels use AES 256 symmetric encryption to control access to items. Supported apps, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, will seamlessly decrypt the item if the recipient is authenticated and authorised. Encryption is not limited to users within the organization, external recipients are also supported.</p>
<p>Document metadata is not encrypted, allowing other applications to read the Sensitivity Labels on a document regardless of whether it is encrypted. Exchange Online and SharePoint (when enabled) are able to remove encryption and re-apply it, allowing them to index and scan content.</p>
<p>There are two aspects that control access to protected items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permissions</li>
<li>Usage Rights</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assigning-permissions">Assigning Permissions</h3>
<p>The following permission options control who can authenticate for access to a protected item:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Assignee</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>All users and groups in your organisation</td>
<td>Any user in your Tenant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Any authenticated user</td>
<td>Users in any Azure AD Tenant, personal MSA accounts, Federated accounts (GMail, Yahoo), Guests, OTP authenticated B2B accounts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Users or groups</td>
<td>Specific users or groups in your Tenant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Specific email addresses or domains</td>
<td>Individual external recipients or entire external email domains</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>External recipients</strong> are fully supported by the above options. If authentication fails the item cannot be opened.</p>
<h3 id="usage-rights-and-permission-levels">Usage Rights and Permission Levels</h3>
<p>Once the recipient is authenticated, the <strong>Publishing License</strong> attached to an encrypted item is checked to determine what <em>usage rights</em> have been assigned.</p>
<p><strong>Usage rights</strong> are granular controls over common activities as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Right</th>
<th>Scope</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>View content (VIEW)</td>
<td>Files</td>
<td>Enables document opening and viewing content. Doesn&rsquo;t allow sorting or filtering in Excel</td>

<td>Enabled all rights to a document including remove protection</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Caveats: Save (EDIT) only grants Save/Save As in the Desktop versions of Office, but it also grants Edit rights in Office for the Web.</p>
<p><strong>Permission Levels</strong> are groups of usage rights that meet the most common requirements, as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Permission Level</th>
<th>Scope</th>

<h3 id="pdf-support">PDF Support</h3>
<p>PDF files can be encrypted and Adobe Acrobat / Acrobat Reader will show a banner message to indicate the applied Sensitivity Label. Since June 2022 versions of Acrobat and Acrobat Reader no longer need a separate plugin.</p>
<p>MS Edge version 83.0.478.37 or higher can also view encrypted PDF files.</p>
<p>If you Save or Print an encrypted Office document to PDF, the resulting PDF will inherit the encryption and permissions.</p>
<h2 id="content-marking">Content Marking</h2>
<p><em>Content Marking</em> puts visual markers directly in the data, specifically, the header, footer or background of a file item and header or footer of an email.</p>
<p>This can be useful as the label is <em>hidden</em> in the item metadata and only displayed in the UI of supported applications. Furthermore, the label only displays in the UI if the Tenant ID in the metadata matches the current Tenant.</p>
<p>In practice, content marking may be as simple as ensuring the Label is clearly visible in the document, or it could be a lengthy paragraph explaining who is allowed to read the content and how it can be shared. Headers and Footers can be up-to 1024 characters in Word and PowerPoint and up to 255 in Excel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/UsingMIPLabels/Label-Marking.png" alt="Content Marking"  />
</p>
<p>Background Watermarks are not supported in email and are normally only be used for high sensitivity documents e.g. to print <em>Confidential</em> diagonally in the background.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-content-marking">Dynamic Content Marking</h3>
<p>Content Marking supports basic conditions and variables, most commonly used to apply different marking based on the document type.</p>
<p>An <em>IF</em> condition can include the name of an Office application, or the single character abbreviation for multiple applications, as shown in the Header marking examples below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-Bash" data-lang="Bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># LABEL POLICY EXAMPLE 1 - Only mark Excel files </span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">If</span><span class="p">.App.Excel</span><span class="si">}</span> CONFIDENTIAL SPREADSHEET: INTERNAL RECIPIENTS ONLY <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">If</span><span class="p">.End</span><span class="si">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Even though the label applies to Word, Excel and PowerPoint files, the header marking is only applied to Excel files</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-Bash" data-lang="Bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># LABEL POLICY EXAMPLE 2 - Target multiple apps</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">If</span><span class="p">.App.WXP</span><span class="si">}</span> PUBLIC: DISTRIBUTE FREELY <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">If</span><span class="p">.End</span><span class="si">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the second example, the header marking is added to Word, Excel and PowerPoint files, but not Outlook emails.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-Bash" data-lang="Bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># LABEL POLICY EXAMPLE - multiple options</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">If</span><span class="p">.App.WO</span><span class="si">}</span> <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">Item</span><span class="p">.Label</span><span class="si">}</span> - This content is confidential. <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">If</span><span class="p">.End</span><span class="si">}</span> <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">If</span><span class="p">.App.PowerPoint</span><span class="si">}</span> <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">Item</span><span class="p">.Label</span><span class="si">}</span> - This presentation is confidential. <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">If</span><span class="p">.End</span><span class="si">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the third example, the header is different for Word and Outlook compared to PowerPoint (and Excel does not apply a header).</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-content-variables">Dynamic Content Variables</h3>
<p>There are only a few variables that can be used in content marking:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Variable</th>
<th>Description</th>

<h2 id="information-protection-licensing">Information Protection Licensing</h2>
<p>Office 365 E3 includes <strong>Information Protection for Office 365 – Standard</strong> and Office 365 E5 includes <strong>Information Protection for Office 365 – Premium</strong>. Broadly these map to manual and automatic labelling. Information Protection is a separate Service Plan with a SKU, allowing it to be selectively enabled for specific users / groups.</p>
<p>An O365 E3 license covers most requirements for manual labelling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual labelling (Sensitivity Labels and Retention Labels) using M365 Apps for Enterprise, Office Online and Office mobile</li>
<li>Manual labelling for containers (Teams / SharePoint / M365 Groups)</li>
<li>Basic Office Message Encryption (OME) including Encrypt only and Do Not Forward email templates</li>
<li>DLP for Exchange Online and SharePoint Online</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>DLP for Teams requires an Office E5 license. Administrators and M365 Group Owners need an Azure AD P1 license to apply labels to containers (included in E3 and E5).</p>
<p>An Office E5 license is needed for most automatic labelling actions and the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically applying Sensitivity Labels and Retention Labels</li>
<li>Default container labels inherited by unlabelled documents (e.g. SharePoint)</li>
<li>Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) and Hold Your Own Key (HYOK) encryption</li>
<li>Double Key Encryption (DKE)</li>
<li>Sensitivity Labels for PowerBI</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>Alternative licensing - add one of the following to an E3 license: Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance, Microsoft 365 E5 Information Protection and Governance, Advanced OME and customer key for Office 365. Refer to the downloadable spreadsheet <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=103006" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Compliance Licensing Comparison</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="role-based-admin-delegation">Role Based Admin Delegation</h2>
<p>M365 administrators working with Information Protection need delegated access to the configuration settings in the Purview Compliance Center. Add users to one of the following built-in roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global Administrator</li>
<li>Compliance Data Administrator</li>
<li>Compliance Administrator</li>
<li>Security Administrator</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, create a custom Azure AD role group and add one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organization Configuration</li>
<li>Sensitivity Label Administrator</li>
<li>Sensitivity Label Reader</li>
</ul>
<p>To review Data Classification Reports (e.g. simulation mode results) you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content Explorer List viewer</li>
<li>Content Explorer Content viewer</li>
</ul>

      <title>Migrate home drives to OneDrive with Microsoft Migration Manager - Pt2</title>

      <description>More things I learned migrating home drives to OneDrive with Migration Manager</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Part two of &ldquo;Notes from the Field&rdquo; for a home drive to OneDrive for Business migration, looking at network routing, multi-geo considerations and scheduling issues.</p>
<h2 id="be-aware-of-network-routing">BE AWARE OF NETWORK ROUTING</h2>
<p>Although the migration tool uses a source UNC path and destination OneDrive URL, files are actually uploaded to Azure blobs before being transferred to OneDrive<br>
e.g. *.blob.core.windows.net</p>
<p>There is a list of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointmigration/mm-prerequisites" target="_blank">required endpoints</a>, and it&rsquo;s important to determine if the migration traffic will route out through the enterprise proxy servers, or go direct e.g. through an ExpressRoute link. This routing will be specific to your network setup.</p>
<h3 id="use-agent-groups-in-an-enterprise-network">Use &ldquo;Agent Groups&rdquo; in an enterprise network</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Agent Groups are a logical grouping within Migration Manager, allowing each migration to use a specific agent or agent(s)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carefully consider the network location of each on-prem migration agent, to optimises the traffic flow and minimise bandwidth impact. The two key considerations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>proximity to the home drive file server</li>
<li>proximity to the Azure/Internet egress link.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assign each agent to an Agent Group based on its location. Use the Agent Group option when scheduling a migration to control which agent is used for a specific migration batch.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-cmd" data-lang="cmd"><span class="line"><span class="cl">SPO Admin Portal <span class="p">&gt;</span> Migration <span class="p">&gt;</span> File Shares <span class="p">&gt;</span> Agents <span class="p">&gt;</span> Select an Agent <span class="p">&gt;</span> Edit <span class="p">&gt;</span> Agent Group
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="scanning-always-uses-the-default-agent-group">Scanning always uses the Default agent group</h3>
<p>Scanning is a pre-migration activity used to identify home drive data issues such as &lsquo;path too long&rsquo;.<br>
While migration tasks can use agent groups, scanning tasks cannot. Scanning automatically uses the Default Agent group.<br>
If the default group has no agents the scanning task will just wait indefinitely for an agent to be added back to the Default group.</p>
<h3 id="group-migration-batches-by-location">Group migration batches by location</h3>
<p>When you use the bulk migration option, the portal imports a CSV file and assigns all entries to the same Migration Agent.
If you are carrying out migrations in multiple locations, you need to group them by location and split into separate CSV files to make efficient use of the network..</p>
<h3 id="run-satelite-geo-migrations-separately">Run Satelite-geo migrations separately</h3>
<p>If you are in a multi-geo tenant, don&rsquo;t mix geolocations in the same migration batch. Migration to a satellite geo needs a modified process with dedicated or modified agent config.</p>
<p>If you are signed into the SharePoint Online Admin portal &ldquo;central geo&rdquo;, switch to the relevant &ldquo;satellite geo&rdquo; using the link in the top left. The go to  Migrations &gt; File Shares. Initially there will be no agents listed.</p>
<p>Run the agentsetup.exe on the migration server and pause on the first screen of the setup wizard. If the agent is already installed, re-run setup to modify the configuration.</p>
<p>With the setup wizard open, edit the following file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-cmd" data-lang="cmd"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nv">%temp%</span>\SPMigrationAgentSetup\SPMigrationAgentSetup\Microsoft.SharePoint.Migration.ClientShared.dll.config
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Under AppSettings, add the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-cmd" data-lang="cmd"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;</span>add key=GeoLocation value=<span class="s2">&#34;FRA&#34;</span> /&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The value must be a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#microsoft-365-multi-geo-availability" target="_blank">valid Azure tenant location code</a> that is already enabled in your tenant.</p>
<p>Save the file and continue the setup wizard. The Migration Manager agent will register in the satellite geo and be visible in the SPO Admin Portal for the relevant Geolocation.</p>
<h2 id="timezone-headaches">TIMEZONE HEADACHES</h2>
<p>Migration tasks can either start immediately or at a specified time. However, the time used in the Migration Manager portal is the time zone tenant home location, not the local time of the administrator accessing the portal.<br>
To schedule a migration outside business hours, the administrator must take account of the local time where the agent is based and convert it to the tenant home time zone.</p>
<p>Scanning tasks don&rsquo;t have a scheduling option. They just start immediately, although they use a lot less bandwidth.</p>
<h2 id="false-positive-scan-warnings">FALSE POSITIVE SCAN WARNINGS</h2>
<p>Temporary MS Office files create false positive warnings in the scanning tab and scan reports. There is no way to ignore the false positives.</p>
<p>The purpose of home drive scanning is to highlight problems such as incompatible file names and long paths. However, it is hard to filter out unimportant issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Numerous files beginning with tilde are flagged as warnings in every report - e.g. &ldquo;~budget 2020.xlsx&rdquo;. These temporary files created by MS Office are often not cleaned-up when a document is closed, but it is safe to skip them during migration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If folder redirection to the home drive is enabled, the scan will flag a warning on every instance of desktop.ini. Again these warnings can be safely ignored as the files are recreated by Windows if needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that the pre-migration scan is a waste of time. It does have some benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>confirms the Migration Manager service account has access to the home drive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provides statistics such as overall home drive size and number of files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>highlights long path issues</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="complex-migration-scheduling">COMPLEX MIGRATION SCHEDULING</h2>
<p>There is nothing in Migration Manager help with user scheduling. Scheduling is required because there is some user impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>User communciation should explain what is changing and link to more information (FAQs, OneDrive training material etc)</li>
<li>Ideally users log off prior to the data copy to prevent issues with files locked in-use</li>
<li>Remote users may need to use PLAP VPN to ensure the home drive mapping is removed at next logon</li>
<li>Post-migration support may be required to help users with the changes (removal of home drive and new data location)</li>
</ul>
<p>If your IT department does not have any scheduling software, you will most likely end-up using spredasheets.</p>
<h2 id="juggling-csv-files">JUGGLING CSV FILES</h2>
<p>An enterprise will need to use the &ldquo;bulk migration&rdquo; option in Migration Manager to migrate large numbers of home drives at a time. This option uses a CSV import to specify source UNC paths and target OneDrive URLs. The CSV must be a set format and a template can be downloaded for this purpose.</p>
<p>The pre-migration file share scan step also uses a CSV file, but unfortuately it uses different fields and headers.</p>
<p>The additional migration steps are likely to also be driven from a list such as a CSV file e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-provisioning OneDrives that don&rsquo;t already exist</li>
<li>Removing Active Directory user homeDirectory and homeDrive</li>
<li>Updating folder redirection policies</li>
<li>Updating home drive ACLs or file shares to prevent post-migration access</li>
</ul>
<p>With multiple CSV files in-play and last minute changes to schedules, user scheduling can be complex in its own right.</p>
<h2 id="summary">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Microsoft Migration Manager is a free but basic migration tool. By the time you have discovered its limitations, you may wish you had paid for an ISV product instead.</p>

      <title>Migrate home drives to OneDrive with Microsoft Migration Manager - Pt1</title>

      <description>Things I learned migrating home drives to OneDrive with Migration Manager.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Part one of &ldquo;Notes from the Field&rdquo; for a home drive to OneDrive for Business migration using Microsoft Migration Manager, covering migration tool considerations, architecture and access requirements.</p>
<h2 id="tool-selection">TOOL SELECTION</h2>
<p>Migration Manager comes from the Microsoft purchase of <a href="https://mover.io/index.html" target="_blank">Mover.io</a> in 2019. It is presented as an Enterprise migration tool that puts more structure around the migration process than the more basic SharePoint Migration Tool. However, be prepared for limited configuration and customisation options. As a basic guide consider the following tool choices for file share migration:</p>
<ul>
<li>SharePoint Migration Tool : Ad hoc data migrations</li>
<li>Migration Manager : Large scale migrations using repetitive process</li>
<li>3rd Party Tool : When you need a lot of control or have a complex process</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-complex-requirements">WHAT ARE COMPLEX REQUIREMENTS?</h2>
<p>Migration Manager focuses on the data migration, but for most companies, this is only part of the story. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to move off folder redirection and offline files</li>
<li>Removing the home drive mapping</li>
<li>Cleaning-up or restricting access to home drives</li>
</ul>
<p>A 3rd-party tool, could be more suitable if you are looking to automate as much of the process as possible.For example, <a href="https://sharegate.com/blog/easier-onedrive-for-business-migration" target="_blank">ShareGate Migration Tool</a> provides a PowerShell interface.</p>
<p>Migration Manager is still attractive as it&rsquo;s effectively free as part of an enterprise M365 license.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">ARCHITECTURE</h2>
<p>Migration Manager consists of the following components:</p>
<h3 id="agents">Agents</h3>
<p>Migration Manager agents run on-premises and perform the data migration, reading data from home drives and copying it to OneDrive for Business.<br>
The agent can be installed directly on a file server (assuming it is a Windows Server), but the recommended deployment is on a dedicated server.</p>
<p>The agent sends heartbeat information to the SharePoint Online (SPO) Admin Portal and downloads scanning and migration tasks in return.</p>
<h3 id="sharepoint-online-admin-portal">SharePoint Online Admin Portal</h3>
<p>The SPO Admin Portal is used to manage the agents and assign migration tasks to them. The &ldquo;Migration&rdquo; blade has tabs for scanning, agents and migrations.</p>
<h3 id="file-shares">File shares</h3>
<p>File shares are host the data being migrated. The migration agent service account needs read access to the data and acceses it over SMB.</p>
<h3 id="proxy-server">Proxy server</h3>
<p>The migration agent communicates with an SPO Admin portal endpoint and the Azure blob service over HTTPs. If the company does not have an Express Route, traffic is likely to go through an enterprise proxy server.</p>
<h2 id="a-lot-of-elevated-access">A LOT OF ELEVATED ACCESS</h2>

<h3 id="why-sharepoint-administrator">Why SharePoint Administrator?</h3>
<p>Under the hood, OneDrive for Business is a personal SharePoint site and from an administrative perspective, Microsoft has done very little to separate OneDrive for Business from SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>There is no OneDrive-specific RBAC. To manage OD4B, you need to be a SharePoint Administrator, and Migration Manager is operated through a blade in the SharePoint Online Admin Console.
The technicians managing and monitoring the data migrations will need the SharePoint Administrator role and so will the Service Account used by the migration agent.</p>
<h3 id="sharepoint-administrator-role-is-not-enough">SharePoint Administrator role is not enough</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A SharePoint Administrator cannot copy data to OneDrive by default, but they can grant themselves the additional rights needed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By default, only the owner (user) has access to OneDrive for Business. One option is to define a OD4B Secondary Admin group at the tenant level, but this will only apply to new OneDrives as they are provisioned.</p>
